Hill climbingAI PROJECT
The steepest-Ascent algorithm is a variation of simple hill climbing algorithm. This algorithm examines all the near nodes of the current state and selects one near node which is closest to the goal state. This algorithm consumes more time as it searches for multiple near nodes.

problem space:-
Thereâ€™s  pizza delivery boy who needs to visit 4 location exactly ones, after which he must return to the location from where he started.
The distance btw each pair of location is known.

Conditions:- 1. visit all the locations 
2. visited only once
3. reach where started.

To find :- shortest
Route possible.
